# Code Generation Roundtrip

Code generation roundtrip from legacy code to UML/Papyrus model and back to generated code. 

This example uses CDT and Papyrus Software Designer extension and can be recreated following the indications in
[Papyrus UML/C++ roundtrip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8gaxUcXU3c). 

Quick start:
- Right click the legacy code project and select "Reverse > To new UML model".
- Copy the generated UML file into a new Papyrus project. 
- Use the generated UML file as source for a new Papyrus Model. 
- In Papyrus, create new diagrams, edit the code and generate code as usual.
